## Session goal

Explain your release management process for a high-traffic service.

## Shadowing passage

> Release management is about de-risking deployments so that shipping code is never stressful. The three tools I use. Feature flags: code is shipped to production before the feature is activated. The flag is off for all users on deploy. I activate it for a small percentage — five percent — and monitor for error rate, latency, and user behavior changes. If anything looks wrong, I toggle the flag off in under a minute. This separates deployment from release, which is one of the most important practices in modern software delivery. Canary deployments: the deployment platform routes a percentage of traffic to the new version while keeping the old version running. Ten percent canary for thirty minutes is my standard. Automated rollback triggers if error rate on the canary rises above a configured threshold relative to the baseline, or if p99 latency increases by more than twenty percent. Blue-green deployment for database migrations: run the new application version against the migrated schema before cutting all traffic over. The old version stays on standby. If the migration causes unexpected problems, cutting back is a traffic switch, not a database revert. Post-release discipline: for any significant change, I actively watch the dashboards for thirty minutes after full promotion. Not because the automated systems can't catch issues, but because human review catches subtle behavioral regressions that metrics don't measure — like a feature that works correctly but is being used differently than expected.

## Key phrases

| Phrase | IPA | Note |
|--------|-----|------|
| separate deployment from release | /ˈsɛpərɪt dɪˈplɔɪmənt frəm rɪˈliːs/ | ship code first, activate feature after — decouples two risky operations |
| automated rollback trigger | /ˈɔːtəmeɪtɪd ˈroʊlbæk ˈtrɪɡər/ | metrics threshold that automatically reverts the deployment |
| blue-green deployment | /bluː ɡriːn dɪˈplɔɪmənt/ | two parallel environments — switch traffic, not databases |

## 30-minute protocol

**Minutes 1–5** — Read the passage silently twice. Focus on meaning, not pronunciation.

**Minutes 6–15** — Shadow aloud with the text visible. 4 full passes. Match rhythm and stress.

**Minutes 16–22** — Shadow without the text. 3 passes. Accept mistakes — keep moving.

**Minutes 23–28** — Record yourself once. Play it back immediately. Note one phrase to improve.

**Minutes 29–30** — Write the phrase you struggled with. Say it 10 times slowly, then at full speed.

## Reflection

How would you roll back a release if the rollback itself breaks something new?


## Anti-Translation Drill — Think in English *(5 min)*

Pick **one key phrase** from today's table. Explain what it means using **only English**.

- No Vietnamese. No dictionary.
- If you don't know a word, describe it: *"It's when you…"* / *"It's similar to…"* / *"The opposite would be…"*
- Then use the phrase in a new sentence about your own experience.

> Goal: Train circumlocution — the skill of explaining anything without knowing the exact word. This is what fluent speakers actually do.

## Self-Check

- [ ] Shadowed ≥3 passes without text
- [ ] Completed anti-translation drill without using Vietnamese
